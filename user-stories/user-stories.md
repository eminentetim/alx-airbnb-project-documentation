Here are **5 user stories** derived from the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone backend:

1. **User Registration**  
   *As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can access the platform as a guest or host.*

2. **Add Property Listing**  
   *As a host, I want to add property details such as title, location, price, and amenities so that potential guests can find and book my property.*

3. **Search and Filtering**  
   *As a guest, I want to search for properties by location, price, and amenities so that I can easily find accommodations that match my preferences.*

4. **Book Property**  
   *As a guest, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can secure my stay for a trip.*

5. **Manage Users**  
   *As an admin, I want to monitor and manage usersâ€™ accounts so that I can ensure the platform is safe and compliant.*

Would you like me to generate more user stories or refine these?
